# SeLinux Basic

- Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a Linux kernel security module that provides a mechanism for supporting access control security policies
 
- SELinux is implemented to provide an additional layer of protection, increase the control over processes execution, and protects against exploits by using multi level security.

- SELinux works by using `Label`s and `Type Enforcement`
